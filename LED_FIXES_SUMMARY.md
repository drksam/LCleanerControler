# LED Issue Fixes Applied

## Problem
When operator is logged in:
- LED 0 shows blue (should be green)
- LED 1 shows white (should be dim red)

## Root Causes Found
1. **Login route LED reset**: The login route was calling `set_login_screen_active()` every time it was accessed, even for authenticated users
2. **Config mismatch**: LED configuration was set to 1 LED instead of 2
3. **Color parsing bug**: Fixed earlier - "dim_red" was being split incorrectly
4. **Success detection**: Fixed earlier - ESP32 wasn't returning "ok" causing false warnings

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Login Route LED Reset (app.py line 2473)
**Before:**
```python
# Set LED to login screen state when page is accessed
if led_initialized and led_controller:
    led_controller.set_login_screen_active()
```

**After:**
```python
# Set LED to login screen state when page is accessed (only if not already logged in)
if led_initialized and led_controller and not current_user.is_authenticated:
    led_controller.set_login_screen_active()
```

This prevents the LED from being reset to login screen colors when an authenticated user accesses the login page.

### 2. Updated LED Configuration (config.py line 73)
**Before:**
```python
'num_leds': 1,  # Number of LEDs in the chain
```

**After:**
```python
'num_leds': 2,  # Number of LEDs in the chain (updated for dual LED setup)
```

### 3. Previous Fixes (already applied)
- Fixed "dim_red" color parsing in `_set_individual_led()`
- Changed LED success detection to not require "ok" response
- Disabled conflicting LED controllers in main.py and rfid_control.py
- Changed default state from IDLE to LOGIN_SCREEN
- Changed IDLE animation from BREATHING to SOLID

## Expected Behavior After Fixes
When a normal user logs in:
- **LED 0 (LED1)**: Green solid (ACCESS_GRANTED state)
- **LED 1 (LED2)**: Dim red solid (placement guide for logged-in state)

When an admin logs in:
- **LED 0 (LED1)**: Purple solid (ADMIN_LOGGED_IN state)
- **LED 1 (LED2)**: Dim red solid (placement guide for logged-in state)

## Testing
1. Restart the Flask application to load the new configuration
2. Access the login page - should show LED1: blue, LED2: white
3. Log in as a normal user - should show LED1: green, LED2: dim red
4. Navigate around the application - LEDs should maintain logged-in colors
5. Log out - should briefly show logout colors then return to login screen colors
