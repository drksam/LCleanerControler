# Persistent State Implementation Summary

## Overview
Extended the persistent state system to include Auto Cycle Mode switch and Run Table button, maintaining their states across page navigation.

## Components Modified

### 1. Backend State Tracking (app.py)

#### Enhanced `/table/status` endpoint:
- Added `auto_cycle_enabled`: Current auto cycle switch state from sequence runner
- Added `auto_cycle_running`: Whether auto cycle is actively running
- Added `table_running`: Whether table is running (manual or auto cycle)
- Added `cycle_count`: Current cycle count for progress display
- Added `cycle_progress`: Current cycle progress percentage

#### Enhanced `/servo_status` endpoint:
- Added `table_states` object containing all table and auto cycle status
- Unified state endpoint for both servo toggles and table operations
- Includes fallback error handling for sequence runner unavailability

### 2. Frontend State Synchronization (operation.js)

#### Enhanced `checkAndSyncServoState()` function:
- **Auto Cycle Switch Persistence**: Restores switch state from server
- **Run Table Button Persistence**: Restores button disabled/enabled state
- **Auto Cycle Progress Restoration**: Restores cycle count and progress display
- **AutoCycleManager State Sync**: Restores internal manager state and callbacks
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Debug information for troubleshooting

#### State Synchronization Triggers:
- **Initial Page Load**: Via `syncUIWithSystemState()`
- **Page Visibility Change**: When user returns from another page/tab
- **Periodic Sync**: Every 10 seconds for ongoing consistency
- **Manual Triggers**: Through existing status polls

## Persistent States Implemented

### Fire/Fiber Toggle Buttons (Already Implemented)
- ✅ Toggle button active/inactive states
- ✅ Firing timer restoration with correct elapsed time
- ✅ Visual button state consistency

### Auto Cycle Mode Switch (New)
- ✅ Switch enabled/disabled state persistence
- ✅ AutoCycleManager internal state synchronization
- ✅ Visual switch appearance restoration
- ✅ Server-client state consistency validation

### Run Table Button (New)
- ✅ Button disabled/enabled state persistence
- ✅ Running state restoration (shows "RUNNING..." when active)
- ✅ Auto cycle progress display restoration
- ✅ AutoCycleManager running state restoration with callbacks

## Technical Implementation Details

### Server-Side State Sources:
1. **Servo States**: From `servo.get_toggle_states()` (servo_control_gpioctrl.py)
2. **Table States**: From `output_controller` properties (table movement)
3. **Auto Cycle States**: From `sequence_runner` properties (cycle management)

### Client-Side State Restoration:
1. **Immediate Sync**: On page load via `checkAndSyncServoState()`
2. **Bidirectional Updates**: UI updates server state, server state updates UI
3. **Progress Restoration**: Cycle count and progress percentages
4. **Callback Restoration**: Re-establishes event handlers for ongoing operations

### Error Handling:
- Graceful fallbacks when sequence runner unavailable
- Warning messages for state inconsistencies
- Logging for debugging state synchronization issues
- Safe handling of missing AutoCycleManager

## Usage Scenarios Supported

### Fire/Fiber Operations:
1. User toggles Fire button → navigates away → returns → button shows active with correct timer
2. User toggles Fiber button → page refresh → button shows active with correct timer

### Auto Cycle Operations:
1. User enables Auto Cycle switch → navigates away → returns → switch shows enabled
2. User starts table operation → navigates away → returns → Run Table button shows "RUNNING..."
3. User starts auto cycle → navigates away → returns → progress display shows correct count/percentage

### Mixed Operations:
1. Fire toggle active + Auto cycle running → page navigation → both states restored correctly
2. Manual table movement + Fiber toggle → page refresh → both states preserved

## Benefits
- **Improved User Experience**: No confusion about current system state
- **Operational Safety**: Clear indication of active operations across navigation
- **Data Integrity**: Consistent state between frontend and backend
- **Debugging Support**: Comprehensive logging for issue resolution

## Future Considerations
- Consider adding state persistence for manual table movement (forward/backward)
- Potential expansion to include stepper motor states
- Consider adding visual indicators during state restoration process
