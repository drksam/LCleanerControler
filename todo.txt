### Remaining Tasks

## 1. API Testing and Documentation [SKIP FOR NOW]

Now that the authentication API has been implemented, we need to:
- Create comprehensive API tests to verify all endpoints
- Document the API for client developers
- Create example API client code for integration
- Set up a monitoring system for API usage

## 2. Error Handling Improvements

The error handling in sequences.js has been improved, but we can still enhance it with:
- More specific error messages for different failure scenarios
- Ability to recover from specific errors without aborting the entire sequence
- Better visualization of errors in the UI

## 3. Performance Optimization

Still need to address:
- Implement virtualization for long sequences in sequences.js
- Optimize AJAX requests to reduce unnecessary server calls

## 4. Code Organization and Documentation
