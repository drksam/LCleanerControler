# End of TODO (2025-07-21 UPDATED)

# Progress Summary - 2025-07-21 (EVENING - STEPPER MOTOR FIXES)
## Major Stepper Motor System Overhaul Completed:

✅ **STEPPER MOTOR DEADLOCK RESOLUTION - FULLY RESOLVED:**
   - **Root Cause Identified**: `threading.Lock()` causing deadlock when `jog()` called `move_to()` while already holding lock
   - **Critical Fix Applied**: Changed `threading.Lock()` to `threading.RLock()` in stepper_control_gpioctrl.py for reentrant locking
   - **Impact**: Stepper motors went from completely frozen to fully functional
   - **Verification**: All stepper operations (jog, index, move_to) now work properly without hanging

✅ **POSITION TRACKING SYNCHRONIZATION - FULLY RESOLVED:**
   - **Issue**: StepperWrapper wasn't updating `_position` in hardware mode, always returned 0
   - **Fix**: Added immediate position updates in gpio_controller_wrapper.py async hardware moves
   - **Implementation**: Position now updates with proper lock protection in `wait=False` calls
   - **Result**: Position tracking stays synchronized between UI and hardware state

✅ **INDEX BUTTON DIRECTION ISSUE - FULLY RESOLVED:**
   - **Problem**: Both index forward and backward buttons moved in same direction
   - **Root Cause**: `move_index()` method didn't accept direction parameter, always used default
   - **Frontend Verification**: Confirmed JavaScript correctly sends 'forward' vs 'backward'
   - **Backend Enhancement**: 
     * Enhanced `move_index(direction=1)` to accept direction parameter (1=forward, -1=backward)
     * Updated Flask `/index_move` route to convert string directions to integers
     * Added backward compatibility with direction=0 converting to -1
   - **Result**: Index buttons now move in proper opposite directions

✅ **LIMIT SWITCH ERROR HANDLING - FULLY RESOLVED:**
   - **Error**: `'str' object has no attribute 'get'` in limit switch state updates
   - **Root Cause**: Controller feedback sometimes returned strings instead of dictionaries
   - **Fix**: Added robust type checking in `update_limit_states()` method
   - **Implementation**: Validates `feedback` and `status` are dictionaries before calling `.get()`
   - **Result**: Limit switches handle malformed controller data gracefully

✅ **HOLD-TO-JOG FUNCTIONALITY - FULLY IMPLEMENTED:**
   - **Feature Request**: Users wanted continuous movement instead of repetitive clicking
   - **Frontend Implementation**: 
     * Added `mousedown`/`mouseup` and `touchstart`/`touchend` event listeners
     * Implemented continuous jog with 200ms intervals while button held
     * Added proper cleanup and button state management
     * Mobile-friendly touch support included
   - **Backend Implementation**: 
     * Created `/jog_continuous` Flask endpoint optimized for rapid calls
     * Async movement pattern for smooth continuous operation
     * Enhanced error handling for continuous movement scenarios
   - **User Experience**: 
     * Hold down jog buttons for smooth continuous movement
     * Automatic stop when button released or cursor leaves button
     * Backward compatible - single clicks still work as before

✅ **ENHANCED ERROR HANDLING AND ROBUSTNESS:**
   - **Type Safety**: Added comprehensive type checking for controller responses
   - **Graceful Degradation**: Better handling of malformed hardware feedback
   - **Improved Logging**: Enhanced debug output for troubleshooting stepper issues
   - **Thread Safety**: All stepper operations now use reentrant locks properly

# Progress Summary - 2024-12-30
## Completed Today:
✅ **PERFORMANCE SCORE DISPLAY FORMATTING FIX (UNTESTED):**
   - **Issue**: Performance scores showing confusing format like "240m 34.2s" instead of proper hours
   - **Root Cause**: formatTime() function in templates/performance.html didn't handle values over 60 minutes properly
   - **Fix Applied**: Enhanced formatTime() function to display hours for values >= 3600 seconds
   - **Expected Result**: "240m 34.2s" should now display as "4h 0m 34.2s" for better readability
   - **Status**: ⚠️ UNTESTED - Requires application restart and testing to verify functionality

✅ **AUTO-SWITCH USER DISPLAY FIX (UNTESTED):**
   - **Issue**: RFID auto-switch updates performance tracking but navbar still shows "admin" instead of switched user
   - **Root Cause**: RFID _create_user_session() updated session tracking but not Flask-Login current_user state
   - **Fix Applied**: Added login_user() call to _create_user_session() method in rfid_control.py
   - **Expected Result**: Top-right navbar should now display actual switched user name after RFID auto-switch
   - **Technical Details**: Integrated Flask-Login authentication state with RFID session tracking system
   - **Status**: ⚠️ UNTESTED - Requires application restart and RFID testing to verify functionality

## Technical Implementation Details:

**Files Modified Today:**
- `templates/performance.html`: Enhanced formatTime() JavaScript function with proper hour formatting
- `rfid_control.py`: Added Flask-Login integration to _create_user_session() method for auto-switch

**Architecture Improvements:**
- **Performance Display**: Hours properly displayed for session durations over 1 hour
- **Authentication Sync**: RFID auto-switch now updates both session tracking and UI display state
- **User Experience**: Both performance times and user switching should provide clearer visual feedback

## Current System State:
- **✅ PERFORMANCE FORMATTING**: Enhanced time display logic implemented for better readability
- **✅ USER SWITCHING**: Flask-Login integration added for consistent navbar user display
- **⚠️ TESTING REQUIRED**: Both fixes implemented but require restart and testing to verify
- **🔄 READY FOR VALIDATION**: Performance page and RFID auto-switch functionality ready for testing

## Testing Plan:
1. **Restart Application**: Required to load updated rfid_control.py changes
2. **Test Performance Display**: Verify times over 1 hour show proper "Xh Ym Zs" format instead of excessive minutes
3. **Test RFID Auto-Switch**: Confirm navbar user display updates when switching users via RFID card scan
4. **Validate Session Tracking**: Ensure both performance tracking and user authentication work together properly

## Session Summary:
**Started**: User reported two specific issues: performance score format confusion and auto-switch not updating navbar
**Completed**: Both UI display issues addressed with targeted fixes for time formatting and authentication state sync
**Impact**: Better user experience with clearer performance times and consistent user display across all interface elements

Both fixes target specific user-reported UI issues and should resolve the confusing performance display and inconsistent user switching behavior.
