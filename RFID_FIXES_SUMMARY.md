# RFID Controller Fixes

## Problems Identified
1. **Application Context Error**: RFID authentication failing with "Working outside of application context" 
2. **Slow/Multiple Scans**: Card scans were slow and required multiple attempts
3. **Database Access Issues**: Background thread couldn't access Flask-SQLAlchemy models

## Root Causes
1. **Missing Flask App Context**: Database queries in background thread without proper Flask application context
2. **No Debouncing**: Rapid multiple scans of same card causing authentication conflicts
3. **Thread Isolation**: Background RFID thread isolated from Flask application context

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Flask Application Context (rfid_control.py)
**Problem**: Database queries failing outside application context
**Solution**: Wrapped all database operations with `with app.app_context():`

**Lines affected:**
- Prototype mode database access (~line 207)
- Local authentication database access (~line 310)
- Access logging already had context wrapper

### 2. Added Card Scan Debouncing (rfid_control.py)
**Problem**: Same card being scanned multiple times rapidly
**Solution**: Added 2-second cooldown between scans of same card

**New variables added to __init__:**
```python
self.last_card_id = None
self.last_scan_time = 0
self.scan_cooldown = 2.0  # 2 seconds between scans of same card
```

**Debouncing logic in _reader_loop:**
```python
# Debouncing: ignore rapid scans of the same card
current_time = time.time()
if (self.last_card_id == id and 
    current_time - self.last_scan_time < self.scan_cooldown):
    continue  # Skip this scan, too soon after last scan of same card

self.last_card_id = id
self.last_scan_time = current_time
```

## Expected Results After Fixes
1. **Faster Card Recognition**: Debouncing prevents authentication conflicts
2. **Successful Authentication**: Database access now works properly from background thread
3. **No More Context Errors**: All database operations wrapped in Flask app context
4. **Consistent LED Response**: Authentication success/failure properly triggers LED states

## Testing
1. Restart the Flask application to load the fixed RFID controller
2. Test card scanning - should be faster and more reliable
3. Check logs - should see successful authentications without context errors
4. Verify LED states respond correctly to card scans
