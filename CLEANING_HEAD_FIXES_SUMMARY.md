# Cleaning Head Page Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Sequences Page Authorization
**Problem**: The sequences page allowed unauthorized user refresh
**Solution**: Added `@login_required` decorator to the `/sequences` route in `app.py`

### 2. ✅ Cleaning Head Layout Reorganization
**Problem**: 
- Index distance area and buttons needed to be repositioned
- Cleaning Head Control Settings area was too wide
- Movement Controls area needed to be wider
- Duplicate Index Distance areas existed
- Duplicate Absolute Position controls existed

**Solution**: 
- Changed layout from 8/4 split to 6/6 split for better balance
- Moved Index Forward/Backward buttons to Movement Controls section
- Put Save Index Distance button directly on the text box input group
- Removed duplicate Index Distance area at bottom of page
- Removed duplicate Absolute Position controls
- Kept only the top Absolute Position control (above the log)

### 3. ✅ Index Distance Button Handler
**Problem**: The Save Index Distance button didn't have a JavaScript handler
**Solution**: Added a new event handler for `save-index-distance` button that:
- Uses the `index-distance` input field (not `index-distance-mm`)
- Converts mm to steps using the conversion factor
- Saves the setting via `/update_config` endpoint
- Provides user feedback in the log

### 4. ✅ Layout Structure (Final)
The page now has a clean 5-section layout:

1. **Position Display** (Full width) - Shows current position in mm and steps
2. **Control Settings (Left) + Movement Controls (Right)** (6/6 split)
   - Settings: Step size, jog speed, index speed, acceleration sliders
   - Movement: Jog buttons, Index buttons, Go to Zero, Enable Motor
3. **Index Distance Settings (Left) + Position Presets (Right)** (6/6 split)
   - Index: Distance input with Save button inline
   - Presets: Saved positions and preset management
4. **Absolute Position Control** (Full width) - Target position controls
5. **Action Log** (Full width) - Activity logging

## ESP32 Enable Pin Logic Analysis

### Current Behavior (CORRECT)
The ESP32 firmware uses the standard stepper driver enable pin logic:
- `HIGH` = Motor disabled (coils de-energized, motor can be turned by hand)
- `LOW` = Motor enabled (coils energized, motor locked in position)

This is correct for most stepper drivers (A4988, DRV8825, TMC2208, etc.)

### Code Locations:
- **Initialization**: `digitalWrite(steppers[id].enablePin, HIGH)` - Motor starts disabled
- **Movement Start**: `digitalWrite(steppers[id].enablePin, LOW)` - Motor enabled for movement
- **Movement End**: `digitalWrite(steppers[id].enablePin, HIGH)` - Motor disabled after movement

If the enable pin behavior seems incorrect, check:
1. **Driver Board Type**: Some custom boards might have inverted logic
2. **Wiring**: Ensure enable pin is connected to the correct driver pin
3. **User Expectation**: The motor should be "loose" when disabled and "locked" when enabled

## JavaScript Handler Compatibility

The code now supports both:
- New `save-index-distance` button with `index-distance` input
- Legacy `update-index-distance` button with `index-distance-mm` input (if present)

## Files Modified

1. **app.py**: Added `@login_required` to sequences route
2. **templates/cleaning_head.html**: Complete layout restructuring, removed duplicates
3. **static/js/cleaning_head.js**: Added handler for new save-index-distance button

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Layout**: Verify responsive behavior on different screen sizes
2. **Index Distance**: Test saving index distance values and verify conversion accuracy
3. **Movement Controls**: Test all buttons work correctly in new layout
4. **Absolute Position**: Verify the remaining Target Position control works
5. **Authorization**: Confirm sequences page redirects unauthorized users to login

## Notes

- The ESP32 enable pin logic is industry standard and should not be changed
- All duplicate elements have been removed for cleaner interface
- The layout is now more balanced and user-friendly
- JavaScript handlers are backwards compatible
