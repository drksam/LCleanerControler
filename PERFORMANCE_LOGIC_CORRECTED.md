# Performance Tracking Logic - CORRECTED

## Summary of Changes Made

### ✅ Fixed Performance Calculation Logic

**Formula**: `Performance Score = Total Session Time - Total Fire Time`

**Interpretation**:
- **Lower scores = Better performance** (less non-productive time)
- Score represents time logged in but NOT firing (non-productive time)
- Best users minimize their non-productive time

### ✅ Examples with Corrected Logic

```
Scenario 1: 10min session, 2min firing = 480 seconds (8.0 minutes non-productive)
Scenario 2: 5min session, 1min firing = 240 seconds (4.0 minutes non-productive)  
Scenario 3: 5min session, 4.5min firing = 30 seconds (0.5 minutes non-productive) - HIGHLY EFFICIENT!
```

### ✅ User Classifications (Corrected)
- **Highly Efficient**: Score < 60 seconds (minimal non-productive time)
- **Efficient Workers**: Score 60-300 seconds (1-5 minutes non-productive time)  
- **Average Users**: Score 300-900 seconds (5-15 minutes non-productive time)
- **Needs Improvement**: Score > 900 seconds (15+ minutes non-productive time)

### ✅ Code Changes Made

1. **models.py**: Updated comment and logic description
2. **app.py**: Fixed sorting logic (lower scores = better, use `<` instead of `>`)
3. **templates/performance.html**: 
   - Updated descriptions to "non-productive time"
   - Fixed sorting (ascending for lower = better)
   - Updated chart labels
4. **templates/base.html**: Made Performance page accessible to all logged in users
5. **USER_SWITCHING_FEATURES.md**: Corrected all documentation

### ✅ Technical Implementation

- **Database**: `UserSession.performance_score` stores the calculated value
- **Calculation**: Triggered when session ends (`logout_time` is set)
- **Integration**: Fire time automatically tracked via `config.add_laser_fire_time()`
- **API**: Performance data available via `/api/sessions/performance`
- **UI**: Real-time leaderboard with correct sorting (best users first)

### ✅ Access Control
- **Performance page**: Now accessible to all logged in users (not just admins)
- **Navigation**: Performance menu item shows for all authenticated users
- **Statistics page**: Still admin-only (unchanged)

The performance tracking system now correctly measures and displays non-productive time, with lower scores indicating better performance (more efficient use of logged-in time).
